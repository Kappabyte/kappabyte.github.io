In my grade 10 year of High School, I was given the oppertunity to participate in Robot in 3 Days (RI3D) with AC robotics. This was a really
cool oppertunity were I was given the chance to work with and learn from students in higher education.

In comparison to the robot I helped create for [Scarlett Robotics](https://scarlettrobotics.com/) (my high school's team), I found this code base was much more extendable, 
and gave me insight about new concepts for me at the time such as lambda expressions, as well as FRC specific concepts like instant commands.

# My Contributions

You can see my contributions to the codebase [here](https://github.com/Alberta-Collegiate-Robotics/RI3D-2020/commits/master/?author=Kappabyte). I was one of
the main contributors to the codebase, working closely with one of the university students who ran the code team.
