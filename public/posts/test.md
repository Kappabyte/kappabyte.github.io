This is a test post to test the markdown rendering of my website.

The highlighted section always evaluates to true!

```js "0 <= 1"
for(let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    console.log(0 <= 1);
    console.log("test");
}
```

## Math Rendering!

Math block:
$$
\Gamma = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}a_i
$$
where $a_i=a_{i-1}+i$ for all $i\geq 1$ and $a_0=0$

This is it.
